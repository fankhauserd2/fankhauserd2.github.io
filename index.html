<p>Ingredients:
<span itemprop="ingredients">1 package of Smithfield® Sweet & Smoky Marinated Fresh Pork Roast</span>
<span itemprop="ingredients">½ cup water</span>
<span itemprop="ingredients">¼ heavy cream</span>
<span itemprop="ingredients">2 tbsp. extra virgin olive oil, plus more for the potatoes</span>
<span itemprop="ingredients">½ yellow onion, roughly diced</span>
<span itemprop="ingredients">8 Yukon Gold potatoes</span>
<span itemprop="ingredients">¼ lb. shredded Monterey Jack cheese,</span>
<span itemprop="ingredients">Minced chives</span>
<span itemprop="ingredients">¼ tsp. coarse sea salt</span>

<p>Instructions:
<span itemprop="recipeInstructions">
  Combine pork and water in a slow cooker and cook on high for 5 hours (do not dispose of the pan juices). Pull pork apart with a fork. Set aside. 
  Pour pan juices into a skillet and bring to boil. Once boiling, add in cream and reduce the liquid by about 1/4 to 1/2 over high heat for about 10-12 min., stirring often. You'll know it's done because it will start bubbling and will become a caramel color. Remove from heat.
  Add the reduced pan sauce to the pulled pork and mix well. Set aside. <br>
  Preheat oven to 350°F.
  Heat the olive oil up in a medium skillet over medium high heat. Add in the onions and cook until caramel brown (caramelizing the onions), stirring often. Set aside.
  Poke your potatoes all over with a fork. Brush the outsides of the potatoes with olive oil. Place on an aluminum foil-lined baking sheet and bake for 50 minutes.
  Remove spuds from the oven and let cool 5 minutes. Slice in half lengthwise and use a spoon to scoop out the inside of each half, leaving a border of about 1/4” - 1/2".
  Fill the inside of the potatoes first with some caramelized onions. Then top with a good hunk of pork and then a sprinkling of cheese.
  Place back into oven at 400°F and cook for 10 minutes, or until the cheese has melted completely.
  Garnish with chives and more caramelized onion pieces and serve.
